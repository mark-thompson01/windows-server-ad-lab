# Building an Active Directory Domain with Group Policies

This repository documents a step-by-step lab project where I built a functional Windows Server 2016 Active Directory environment from scratch in a virtualized setup.  
The goal of this lab was to gain hands-on experience with Active Directory, DNS, DHCP, Group Policy Objects (GPOs), and PowerShell for managing and automating domain services.

Each section below links to a live webpage that details a specific phase of the lab, including configuration steps and screenshots.

## 🔁 How to Recreate This Lab

To recreate this lab environment:

1. Install [Oracle VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
   
2. Create a virtual machine and install Windows Server 2016.
   
3. Configure DNS and DHCP roles.

4. Promote the server to a domain controller using Active Directory Domain Services.

5. Join a client computer to the new domain.

6. Create and link Group Policy Objects (GPOs) for security and user configuration.
